# WLED Simulator

A minimal but extensible desktop application that behaves like a real WLED node while running entirely on your workstation. It offers a Fyne-powered LED matrix, a WLED-compatible JSON REST API, and a full-speed DDP UDP listener, making it ideal for client development and automated integration tests.
